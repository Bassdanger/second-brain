#cloudformation

- CloudFormation
	- A declarative way of outlining your AWS Infrastructure, for any resources (most of them are supported)
	- Can say what you want in a CloudFormation template
	- Then CloudFormation creates those for you in the right order, with the exact configuration that you specify
- Benefits of AWS CloudFormation
	- Infrastructure as code
		- No resources are manually created
		- code can be versioned controlled using Git
		- Changes to the infrastructure are review through code
	- Cost
		- Each resources within the stack is tagged with an identifier
		- You can estimate the costs of your resources using the CloudFormation template
		- Savings strategy: automation deletion
	- Productivity
		- Ability to destroy and re-create an infrastructure on the cloud
		- Automated generation of Diagram for your templates
		- Declarative programming
	- Separation of concern: create many stacks for many apps, and many layers. Ex:
		- VPC stacks
		- Network Stacks
		- App stacks
	- Don't re-invent the wheel
		- Leverage existing templates on the web
