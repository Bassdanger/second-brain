- YAML Crash Course
	- YAML and JSON for CloudFormation
	- JSON is horrible for CF
	- Key value Pairs
	- Nested Objects
	- Support Arrays
	- Multi line strings
	- Can include comments
- CloudFormation Update Behavior
	- CloudFormation updates resources based on differences between what you submit and stack's current template
	- Which method to use depends on which property you update for a resource
	- Update with No Interruption
		- Without disrupting resources operation & without changing physical ID
	- Update with Some Interruption
		- Example: updating an EC2 instance type from t2.micro to t2.large
	- Replacement
		- Recreating the resource with new physical ID
		- Creates the new resource, change references from other resources to the new resource, then deletes the old resource
		- Example: updating an RDS DB Instance availability zone
- Deleting a S3 bucket
	- You can't delete a non-empty S3 bucket
	- Must delete all objects inside it first
