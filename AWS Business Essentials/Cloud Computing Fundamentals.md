#cloud_computing 

- The Definition of Cloud Computing
	- On-demand, self-service
	- Broad network access
	- Resource pooling
	- Rapid elasticity
	- Measured Service
- Comparing Cloud Computing to Traditional IT
	- Traditional IT  / Legacy IT
		- A company may lease space in a data center or own a whole building
		- The IT equipment is owned by the company
		- IT must design, build, and manage equipment
		- Has a lot of costs such surrounding the data center building
- Cloud Computing Deployment Models
	- Private Cloud 
		- VMware, Microsoft, RedHat, OpenStack
		- Complete control
		- Security
	- Public Cloud
		- AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCP
		- Connected using internet
		- Can use Services
		- Pay as you go
		- Elasticity
	- Hybrid Cloud
		- Connected to internet
		- Keeps critical applications and sensitive data off the cloud or private cloud
	- Multicloud
		- Using multiple clouds
	- Private Cloud - you own the house
	- IaaS - Having a room in the hotel, you must maintain the room
	- PaaS - Developers upload code everything else is handled
	- SaaS - Only consume the service
- Scalability and Elasticity 
	- Elasticity scales by demand
	- Compute Scaling OUT (More instances), Compute Scaling UP (More resources), Database Scaling OUT (Spread the load)
- High Availability
	- If one instance fails, the application automatically fails over
- Fault Tolerance
	- If one fails, the other one will be there to help, redundancy
	- Redundant components allow the system to continue to operate
