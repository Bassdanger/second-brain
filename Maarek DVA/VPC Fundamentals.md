#vpc

- VPC, Subnets, Internet Gateways & NAT Gateways
- Security Groups, Network ACL (NACL), VPC Flow Logs
- VPC Peering, VPC Endpoints
- Site to Site VPN & Direct Connect
- VPC is a private network to deploy your resources
- Subnets allow you to partition your network inside your VPC
	- Public subnet - accessible from internet
	- Private subnet - not accessible to the internet
- Route Tables - define access to the internet and between subnets
- Internet gateway - helps vpc instances connect to internet
	- Public subnets have route to internet gateway
- NAT Gateways & NAT Instances allow instances in private subnets to access internet while remaining private
	- NAT Gateway - aws managed
	- NAT instances - self managed
- NACL (Network ACL) - firewall that controls traffic from and to subnet
	- Subnet level
	- Rules only include IP addresses
- Security Groups
	- A firewall that controls traffic to and from an ENI / EC2 Instance
	- Only allow rules
	- can include ip addresses or other security groups
- VPC flow logs - captures information going into interfaces
	- VPC
	- Subnet
	- Elastic Network Interface
	- Helps monitor issues
- VPC Peering
	- Connects to two VPC privately
	- Behaves as if they were in the same network
	- Most not have overlapping CIDR
	- Are NOT transitive, only one to another one
- VPC Endpoints
	- Allow you to connect to AWS services using a private network
	- Better security
	- VPC Endpoint Gateway
	- Only used within your VPC
- Site to Site VPN
	- Connect an on-premises VPN to AWS
	- Encrypted
	- Over public internet
- Direct Connect (DX)
	- physical connection between on-premises and AWS
	- private, secure, fast
	- goes over a private network
	- takes a month to setup
- Subnets
	- Tied to an AZ, network partition of the VPC
- LAMP Stack EC2
	- Linux
	- Apache
	- MySQL
	- PHP
- When using VPC Endpoints, what are the only two AWS services that have a Gateway Endpoint available?
	- Amazon S3 and DynamoDB
- A web application hosted on a fleet of EC2 instances managed by an Auto Scaling Group. You are exposing this application through an Application Load Balancer. Both the EC2 instances and the ALB are deployed on a VPC with the following CIDR `192.168.0.0/18`. How do you configure the EC2 instances' security group to ensure only the ALB can access them on port **80**?
	- Add an Inbound Rule with port 80 and ALB's Security Group as the source
