- HUB
	- networking device allows more than two connections
	- Anything received on any port is transmitted on every other port
	- no device addressing all data is processed by everyone
	- like shouting in a room with saying no names
	- multiple devices transmitting at once will cause a collision
	- no media access control and no collision detecting 
	- dumbest layer which is why high layers will help it
