#networking #vpc 

- CIDR
	- method for allocating IP addresses
	- Used in Security Groups rules and AWS networking in general
	- defines an IP address range
	- Has two components
		- Base IP
			- Contained in the range
		- Subnet Mask
			- Defines how many bits can change in IP
			- /0, /24, /32
	- Subnet Mask
		- The lower the subnet number we have more IP addresses in the range
		- /0 allows for all IPs
- Public vs Private IP
	- The IANA established blocks of IPs only used for Public and Private
	- Private IP can only allow certain values
- VPC in AWS
	- VPC = Virtual Private Cloud
	- Can have multiple VPCs in an AWS region (max 5 per region soft limit)
	- Max CIDR per VPC is 5 for each CIDR
		- Min size /28
		- Max size /16
	- VPC is private, only private IPv4 ranges allowed
	- YOUR VPC CIDR SHOULD NOT OVERLAP WITH YOUR OTHER NETWORKS
- VPC - Subnet (IPv4)
	- AWS reserves 5 IP addresses (first 4 & last 1) in each subnet
- Internet Gateway (IGW)
	- Allow resources in a VPC to connect to the internet
	- Scales horizontally, highly available, and redundant
	- Must be created separately from a VPC
	- One VPC can only be attached to one IGW and vice versa
	- Internet gateways on their own do not allow internet access
	- Route tables must also be edited
