#mfa #multi-factor_authentication 

- `Factors` - different pieced of evidence which prove identity
	`Knowledge` - Something you know (user, pass)
	`Possession` - Something you have (card, mfa app)
	`Inherent` -Something you are (face, fingerprint)
	`Location` - physical location, which network (corp or wifi)
- More factors mean more security
