#ip_addressing #subnetting #ipv4_addressing 

- IPv4 standard created in 1981 RFC791
- 0.0.0.0 -> 255.255.255.255 = 4,294,967,296 Addresses
- Originally, directly managed by IANA
- Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
- Parts now delegated to regional authorities
- All public IPv4 addressing is allocated
- Part of the address space is private ... can be used/reused freely
- IPv4 Address  Space
	- Class A address space Start 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255
		- Contains 128 networks
		- Generally used for huge networks like apple, government, military, etc in the early days of the internet, but has since been giving up 
	- Class B Start 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
		- 16,384 networks
		- was used for larger businesses that didn't need class A space
	- Class C Start 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255
		- Historically was used for small businesses that weren't large enough for the other two
	- There is also class D and class E

- Defined by a standard RFC1918
- 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (1 x Class A network) private ranged usually used by cloud networks
- 16,777,216 IPv4 addresses
- 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (16 x Class B networks)
- 16 x 65,536 IPv4 Addresses
- 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (256 x Class C networks) home and small office networks
- 256 x 256 IPv4 Addresses
- Also aim to allocate non overlapping ranges
- IPv4 Address Space
	- IPv4 space ain't shit compared to IPv6 space

- IP Subnetting
	- /16 for example
	- /16 is the prefix of the IP address
	- /16 becomes 2 * 2/17 split into 2
	- you can even make it smaller to be two /18 networks
	- Networks are usually split into 2, 4, 8...
	- While unusual, odd number splits are valid
	- Subnetting is the process of taking a larger network, and breaking it into more smaller networks (higher prefix)
