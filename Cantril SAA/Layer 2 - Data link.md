#data_link #data_link_layer

- most critical layer of the OSI 7 layer model
- data link layer lies over layer 1, needs the physical layer to operate 
- ethernet
- frames - format for sending information over a layer 2 network
- mac address is introduced here, not software assigned, uniquely attached to a piece of hardware 
- layer 2 provides frames and other things, layer 2 handles the physical transition and reception of the shared medium
- layer 1 does not understand what a frame is, it just sends and receives it
- the payload in the frame is provided by layer 3

- CSMA/CD
	- Layer 2 controls how the data is sent to prevent collisions in layer 1
	- ![[Pasted image 20240918191549.png]]
	- CSMA looks for a Carrier signal, basically meaning it's looking if a message is already being sent before sending it off to Layer 1
	- If a carrier signal is detected it will wait before sending a frame
	- Mac addresses allow for machine to machine communication]
	- Layers are independent, they only see each other even if it is using a lower layer
	- What happens if both machines check for a carrier signal then send at the same time, then a collision happens! Layer 2
	- If a collision is detected then a jam signal is send and a backoff period occurs when no one sends. This is what CD handles. If it happens again, the backoff period happens again but for a longer period.
	- HUB
		- Hubs are layer 1 devices 
		- Everyone will get the frame but only the desired recipient will keep it while the others discard it
		- One collison can cause all the devices to experience a collision and be repeated
		- A switch can prevent this

	- SWITCH 
		- Switches are a layer 2 device
		- Switches understand frames and MAC Addresses.
		- Uses a MAC Address Table
		- Sends based on the address
		- Will only operate on one port so it won't crash the whole thing with collisions
		- Will store and forward frames

- Identifiable devices
- Media access control (sharing)
- Collison Detection
- Unicast 1 on 1 communication
- Broadcast 1 to all
- Switches - Hubs with super powers ]
- Everything else builds on layer 2
