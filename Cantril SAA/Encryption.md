- Encryption Approaches
	- Encryption At Rest
	- Encryption In Transit

- Encryption Concepts
	- Plaintext
	- Algorithm
	- Key
	- Ciphertext

- Symmetric Encryption
	- aes-256 is an algorithm that needs a key
	- great for local stuff but not for transferring between two remote parties, or time sensitive

- Asymmetric Encryption
	- public key gets the ciphertext , the private key can decrypt the dame 
	- public gets uploaded to cloud for anyone to access it
	- public key encrypts data and turns plaintext to ciphertext
	- once the ciphertext is sent the private key which only one person has can open it

	- computation is much more difficult so it's usually only use for first time communication 
- Signing
	- Also uses Asymmetric keys 
		- Sender uses private key to sign message and send it
		- Receiver can use public key from sender to verify it came from sender by looking at if private key signed it
		- ID verification, log in

	- Steganography
		- Hiding data in an image or anything
		- Basically hidden data being sent
		- Uses algorithms to do so
