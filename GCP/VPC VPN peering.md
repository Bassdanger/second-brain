1) create VPC, subnet (unique CIDR), ssh (for bastion host), icmp (source range should be partners CIDR) FW rules  
  
2) create a VM, put it in the new VPC, NO EXTERNAL IP is needed, Â and share internal IP with partner  
  
3) go to Network Connectivity menu then VPN then classic VPN  
  
4) VPN gateway:  
add settings, put it in your region that you choose, create static ip address and record it  
(only your info goes here)  
  
5) tunnel settings: *one partner* generates IKE secret and shares it, It must be the same for both.  
Remote peer IP address: your partner's static IP  
IKE version: v2  
Choose route based tunnel and for "Remote network IP ranges" add partners subnet CIDR range  
  
tear down:  
- delete tunnel  
- delete cloud vpn gateway  
- release static ip (in VPC menu)  
- delete vm  
- delete vpc (if you created one for today)
